This is my in progress task app that organizes what you need to do based on Franklin Covey's principles of prioritization.

# Overview

I have an app I really want to make that I haven't seen something on the market. Now, you may think that a task app or a todo list is something super common to make, but I enjoy using Franklin Covey Planners and there isn't an app that has the task management techniques that Covey teaches. So this is the beginning of my app I am making for not only my own leisure but hopefully lots of other busy people! This project will also help me elaborate on my recent Kotlin skills I've been developing.

The app is very simple as of now...you have a text box to input a task, you click the submit button, and it gets displayed on the screen. As of now that is all I've gotten working...and for someone who is brand new to app development and Kotlin, I am pretty proud of the work I've put into it. 

The purpose of this app is to help you prioritize better and make more time for the things that matter. When you focus on the things that are important and are urgent then you get rid of wasted time and end up having more leisure time in the long run.

# Development Environment

Android Studio with Kotlin and JDK is required. I found it helpful to run an emulator as well on my android phone. The virtual emulator was a little choppy for me and made my laptop almost explode. 

The Kotlin language is used but a little bit of XML knowledge is required. 

# Useful Websites

I basically taught myself only using Android Studio. I made some tutorial apps that they showed me and messed around with the tutorial knowledge they gave me to create my own app. Basic Kotlin syntax also came in handy.

# Future Work

* Remove button to remove tasks
* Add extra activities or different screens to see different priority of tasks
* Make a more elegant format
